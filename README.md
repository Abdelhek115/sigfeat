Signal Feature Extraction Framework
===================================

A Signal Feature Extraction Framework inspired by luigi and dreams is being created in this repo.
Until the first release this repo grows in the development branch.
Good ideas or help welcome :-)


Developed with focus on audio signals.

Architecture
------------

Seven principal classes build up the whole framework:

1. Feature
2. Source
3. Sink
4. Extractor
5. Preprocess
6. Parameter
7. Metadata
